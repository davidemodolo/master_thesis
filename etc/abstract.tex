With the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing
interest in developing agents capable of understanding and executing complex tasks.
In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for building an agent that can navigate
and complete logistics tasks (mainly pickup and deliver parcels) in a web-based environment.

Our approach studies the raw performance of an LLM without any additional framework
on top, to assess its inherent capabilities. We evaluate the agent's performance
across different maps and goal configurations, focusing on how the agent
navigates the map and completes its tasks. The evaluation heavily relies on LLM uncertainty
measures (tokens' log-probability based), which provide insights into the model's
confidence in its decision-making process.
