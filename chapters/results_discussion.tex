Explain rationale behind the choice of goal positioning.

\section{Map Orientation}

We also considered the orientation of the map included in the prompts. It is
worth noting that the way the map is presented to the model shows a bias towards
a specific orientation (a programming matrix and not a cartesian plane).

This because the prompt does not include any information about the orientation
and we also tried by moving the (0,0) to the bottom left corner and scaling
everything but the result is just the same but rotated 90 deg, as can be seen in
Figure \ref{fig:orientation}.

Show that if overlapping the same portion, different values of the heatmap.

\section{Closest Cell to the Goal Problems}
\label{sec:closest_cell_to_the_goal_problems} more than one cell could bring the
agent closer to the final goal. [add image similar \ref{fig:extra} but with goal
one tile to the right]
