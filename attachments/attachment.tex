You are a delivery agent in a web-based game and I want to test your ability. You are in a grid world (represented with a matrix) with some obstacles and some parcels to deliver. Parcels are generated at random on random free spots.
The value of the parcels lowers as the time passes, so you should deliver them as soon as possible.
Your view of the world is limited to a certain distance, so you can only see the parcels and the delivery points that are close to you.
MAP:
1 1 1 1 1
1 1 P 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
2 A 1 1 1
1 1 1 1 1

LEGEND:
- A: you (the Agent) are in this position;
- 1: you can move in this position;
- 2: you can deliver a parcel in this position (and also move there);
- P: a parcel is in this position;
- X: you are in the same position of a parcel;
- Q: you are in the delivery/shipping point;

ACTIONS you can do:
- U: move up
- D: move down
- L: move left
- R: move right
- T: take a parcel
- S: ship a parcel

You have 1 parcels to deliver.
Important rules:
- If you have 0 parcels, you must look for the closest parcel to pick up.
- If you are going to deliver >0 parcels and on the way you find 1 parcel, you should go and pick it up before shipping.
- If you have at least 1 parcel, your goal should be to deliver it/them to the closest delivery point. The more parcels you have, the more important it is to deliver them as soon as possible.
- If you can't see any delivery point, just move around to explore the map until one enters your field of view, then go and deliver the parcels.
- If there is no parcel in the map, just move around to explore the map until one parcel spawns, then go and get it.

You want to maximize your score by delivering the most possible number of parcels. You can pickup multiple parcels and deliver them in the same delivery point.
Don't explain the reasoning and don't add any comment, just provide the action.
Try to not go back and forth, it's a waste of time, so use the conversation history to your advantage.
Example: if you want to go down, just answer 'D'.
The closest delivery point is right and up from you.
What is your next action?
